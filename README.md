Welcome to my 24-Hour JavaScript Mastery Challenge repository! ðŸš€ In this exhilarating coding journey, I embarked on a quest to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, cover a wide range of topics, and even build a Screen Recording app. This repository houses the code and project from the challenge.

## What's Inside

- **CodeWithHarry Playlist:** I completed the CodeWithHarry JavaScript playlist, which includes comprehensive video tutorials covering JavaScript from the ground up.

- **Mini Projects:** Along the way, I undertook the creation of project to apply the concepts I learned and put my skills to the test.

- **Screen Recording App:** I built a Screen Recording app during the challenge. You can [try it here](https://atharvajoshi12.github.io/Screen-Recording-App/).

## How to Use

1. **Exploration:** Feel free to explore the code and project to see how I tackled various JavaScript concepts.

2. **Contribution:** If you have suggestions, improvements, or want to collaborate, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
